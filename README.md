# Skyflix

Skyflix is a web application for users to efficiently search for and query movies and their corresponding information. The application uses the Movies dataset from Kaggle, which is taken from the Full MovieLens Dataset.

Originally, the dataset is composed of 7 comma-separated values (CSV) files, which, in total, contains metadata of about 45,000 movies and 26,000,000 ratings from 270,000 users obtained from the official GroupLens website.

One problem users often encounter is difficulty in choosing which movies to watch. Given that, Skyflix aims to solve that problem by helping users choose movies they seek by providing meaningful queries that would be able to sort and filter different movies to their preference. We wanted to provide more in-depth search, sort, and filter queries, such as being able to look for movies using certain keywords, or view the most popular movies under a certain genre released in a certain year.
